# Raumklang
An open source room impulse response measurement software using the sine sweep
method.

## The Goal
The goal is to create a fully open source room impulse response measurement
software with first class support of the Linux audio drivers (currently Jack
only).

## Current State
The project started as a sandbox to learn more about DSP and room impulse
response measurement in general. Currently, There is a [CLI app](raumklang-cli) to produce
different kinds of signals and perform basic room impulse response measurements.
At the moment most work is done on the [GUI app](raumklang-gui) with the goal to
introduce basic features to analyse room impulse response measurements. In the
end common features will land in the projects [core library](raumklang-core).
